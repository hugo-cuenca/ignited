# ignited

Rapid early-ramdisk system initialization, accompanying initramfs generator. **CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT**

## What?
ignited is a simple program meant to run before your Linux system partition has even been
mounted! This crate currently serves the purpose of reserving the name `ignited` in crates.io,
and contains no other code than the standard "Hello, world!".
