# GOALS
- [ ] Fast image-generation and boot time
  - [ ] Fast image-generation time
    - [ ] Generic image
    - [ ] Device-specific image
  - [X] Fast boot time
    - [ ] Benchmark average boot time between `mkinitcpio`, `dracut`, `booster`
      - [ ] Image scenarios
        - [ ] Generic image
        - [ ] Device-specific image
      - [ ] Partition scenarios
        - [ ] Simple `ext4` root
        - [ ] Simple `ext4` root w/ separate `f2fs` `/usr` partition
        - [ ] `btrfs` on LUKSv2 volume as root
        - [ ] LVM on LUKSv2 volume, logical volume #1 being a 10G `xfs` partition


- [ ] Compatibility with as many distributions as possible
  - [X] Do not depend on distro-specific programs, commands, or behaviors
  - [X] Compatible with glibc and musl
  - [X] Can be statically or dynamically linked
  - [ ] Testing

- [ ] Contain as close to no external dependencies as possible
  - [ ] Only include kernel modules and statically-compiled ignited binary on simple cases
    - [X] Single, kernel-supported filesystem partition as root
    - [X] Separate root and `/usr` kernel-supported filesystem partitions
    - [ ] Single, kernel-supported filesystem partition with plain dm-crypt encryption as root
    - [ ] Single, kernel-supported filesystem partition with LUKSv1/LUKSv2 encryption as root
  - [ ] Include standard applications (along with their required libs, linker) when required
    - [ ] `lvm2` - LVM logical volumes
    - [ ] TODO: expand this list
